Dear reader,

I’ve decided obliviously to write this entry, you’ll be reading my stream of consciousness as is, so if you think it’s a waste of your time you can leave.

I’ve just finished watching Steve Jobs' 2005 Stanford commencement address, this means it’s a case of emergency, that Radwan’s worst of ideas came out loose dwelling down his streets of mind. The speech did a pretty great job of calming me down, these things about connecting the dots, his ideas about death etc, always felt relatable to me, I still can’t even see the dots i wanna connect, but it’s gonna be good.

I’m currently in a place where I don’t feel happy, for things the observer will identify as easily changeable, but the weight is heavy on the inside. I hate the current state of affairs really, I’m gonna end them, sooner or later, and for the better or better, because there’s no worse in these situations, but to use Zuhayr bin Abī Sulma expression: “troubles of life” are always there, and I’ve to deal with them. (Honestly I took quick dive into the translation of the Mu'allaqat to find a pretentious, heavy-worded expression for “troubles of life” but I didn’t find any).

Anyways, if my depression gets back, it’ll be the end of my good life as I know it, I don’t have the liberty to cave in, wish me good luck, and the strength to take postponed decisions. Also wish me (and I wish you all) to live long enough to witness the fall of israel.

Thank you,
Radwan
