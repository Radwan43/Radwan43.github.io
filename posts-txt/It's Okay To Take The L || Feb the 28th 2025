A multitude of experiences I had since the age of 16 gave me.. well a multitude of real life experience. To the point sometimes I think I've seen it and did it all. And while this gave me the enough confidence to shoot through rocks it also gave me the side of effect of always not accepting the slightest of my mistakes, and the little Ls that I take from time to time. And my habit of introspection didn't help it all, I catch myself thinking of the past everyday, being almost its prisoner. 

Well... I still dunno will I ever reach the age of ultimate wisdom when no mistakes should be accepted, but I'm still 20 now, so this is definitely not the age. There's still time to do mistakes, rinse, and repeat, it's not about not feeling the pain of doing taking such wrong decisions or going through faulty roads, it's about accepting them, embracing them, and using that pain to sculpt another version of me, a better one. 

I got rid of my god-complex, but i replaced it with another extreme that keeps being sorry about everything, well.. I don't think I'm staying like that, fuck it we ball (gently)
