        <div class="article-content">
            <p>Having a loved one is an essential part of the human experience for me. I know how to live on my own and be happy alone, but I’d still believe that it’s essential to have someone to share these days with. It’s not just it feels better, it feels different, it’s a whole new set of experiences that you could never live on your own, or that’s at least how she makes me feel. </p>

<p>C is beautiful, she’s full of life, so warm, and so sweet. And (yes I’m starting a whole new sentence with an “And” you grammar rat) I just fell for it, and I keep falling. I never thought that I’d love someone that bad, and obsess over their details that much. I never thought that I’d make these silly tiktoks, or have my tongue out so I can remake the stupid cats picture with her (if you read this, your cat pictures are not stupid darling, ily). You never think that you’d care that much but you find your whole day ruined because the princess feels bad, or a muddy day becomes instantly good because she sent you a picture smiling. </p>

<p>You feel it in your soul, you feel like you have seen their eyes in a different life, you feel like their touch is a part of your body, and their scent as the flowers of eden. </p>

<p>I rate my gf a 10/10, easily a hit and differently recommend. - Radwan </p>

<p>P.S.: I recommend finding you a gf, stay away from mine. </p>
