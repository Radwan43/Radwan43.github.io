            <p>“I didn't kill myselfwhen things went wrongI didn't turnto drugs or teachingI tried to sleepbut when I couldn't sleepI learned to writeI learned to writewhat might be readon nights like thisby one like me” </p>

<p>- Leonard Cohen  </p>

<p>This is my fourth blog in, what, three years? From Jekyll to WordPress to MicroBlog, every blogging solution had its downsides, so I had to take matters into my own hands. A completely custom solution—one I have full control over—yet so simple that I wrote it in just a couple of hours. Using it is as easy as writing a post and then running a C program. </p>

<p>It’s not a finished project by any means—yet—but in its current state, it’s a fully functional blog. No JavaScript, just pure HTML files with baked-in styles, and it’ll stay that way. I haven’t tested compatibility with older browsers yet, but it should be fine. The only downside is that you can’t disable SSL/TLS for GitHub Pages, which means my 26-year-old iMac G3 won’t be able to view this page. But I’m not really in the mood to spin up a custom hosting solution—maybe a future project with a Raspberry Pi or something. </p>

<p>I plan to add an Arabic section for when I feel like writing in Arabic. The "Who’s Radwan?" section is still pending updates <b>Update: It's live now..</b>, but I’m not sure how much info I can share before I start doxxing myself online. As for the basement? Well, it’ll be a basement—home to my darker ideas and entries. </p>

<p>The source is available on GitHub. All anyone needs to do is change the blog name, and voilà—they’re ready to go. It’s not a solution for non-techies, but I’m pretty sure any monkey with basic coding experience can make this their own in less than five minutes. </p>

<p>Shoutout to LLMs and GitHub Pages for making this a reality—and to Tokhy for inspiring me to do it. </p>

<p>Ciao! </p>
